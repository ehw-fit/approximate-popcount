# Library of approximate PC and PCC circuits
This library provides approximate implementations of popcount and popcount-compare circuits. Moreover, it provides a sketch of how to use it to approximate a TNN neural network.
The library consists of hardware and software models of approximate circuits that are designed to be easily used in arbitrary applications.

## Results
This repository shows the Verilog approximate implementations of two mathematic operations: popcount ($pc(a) = \sum_{\forall x \in A} {x}$) and binary relation operator popcount-compare ( $pc(a) \geq pc(b)$ ). 

For more details, please see the original paper.
